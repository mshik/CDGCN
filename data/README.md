After downloading the dataset, you will need to preprocess it using data_preprocessing.ipynb. Please note that the pretrained protein embedding weights are from the ProSE model by Bepler et al. It is required to install the ProSE software and the pretrained model which is provided in this link: [ProSE](https://github.com/tbepler/prose)<br> to successfully run the notebook "data_preprocessing.ipynb".
