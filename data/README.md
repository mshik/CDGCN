After downloading the dataset, you will need to preprocess it using data_preprocessing.ipynb.<br>
Please note that the pretrained protein embedding weights are from the <i>bio_embeddings<\i> module by Dallago et al. It is required to install the bio_embeddings software provided in this link: [bio_embeddings](https://github.com/sacdallago/bio_embeddings) to successfully run the notebook "data_preprocessing.ipynb".
